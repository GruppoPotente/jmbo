Welcome to Jmbo's documentation!
================================

Jmbo is a set of Django applications that aims to make your life even easier than it already is. It adds a content layer on top of Django and then makes working with that content productive. It also adds some useful functionality not provided by Django itself. Jmbo makes rich portal development a breeze.
